- All variable & function names that end up in HTML / JS / CSS space please follow `camelCase`
    - This rule may be broken if the variable name has to be parsed later.
    - Example: `<input id="itp-2023-{month_nr}" ...` had to be parsed into `itp` `year` `month`

- All variable & function names that are used for rust have to follow `snake_case` anyway
